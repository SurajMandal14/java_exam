## Question 1

**With the help of a clear diagram discuss the hardware failure curve and software failure curve. Explain briefly three major components of the software. Briefly discuss four major factors contributing to the software crisis.**

### a) Hardware Failure Curve (Bathtub Curve) and Software Failure Curve

**Hardware Failure Curve (Bathtub Curve):**

The hardware failure rate as a function of time is often characterized by the "bathtub curve." This curve has three distinct phases:

1.  **Infant Mortality (Early Failure Period):**
    *   This phase occurs at the beginning of a product's life.
    *   The failure rate is initially high but decreases rapidly over time.
    *   Failures are typically due to manufacturing defects, substandard components, or design flaws that were not caught during testing.
    *   "Burn-in" testing is often used to weed out these early failures before products reach customers.
    *   *Diagrammatic Description:* The curve starts high on the Y-axis (failure rate) and slopes steeply downwards.

2.  **Useful Life (Constant Failure Period):**
    *   This is the longest phase of a product's life.
    *   The failure rate is relatively low and constant.
    *   Failures during this period are considered random and are caused by unavoidable stress factors or events that exceed the design strength of the component.
    *   Preventive maintenance can help prolong this phase.
    *   *Diagrammatic Description:* The curve is flat and close to the X-axis.

3.  **Wear-out (End-of-Life Period):**
    *   This phase occurs as the product ages and components begin to deteriorate due to accumulated stress, fatigue, corrosion, or depletion of materials.
    *   The failure rate starts to increase significantly.
    *   Preventive replacement of aging components may be necessary.
    *   *Diagrammatic Description:* The curve slopes upwards, indicating an increasing failure rate.

**(A textual representation of the Bathtub Curve would show failure rate on the Y-axis and time on the X-axis, with the curve shaped like a bathtub: high left side, low flat middle, and rising right side.)**

**Software Failure Curve:**

Unlike hardware, software does not "wear out" in the physical sense. Software failures are primarily due to design defects, coding errors, or incorrect requirements. The software failure curve has different characteristics:

1.  **Idealized Curve:**
    *   Initially, the failure rate is high as the software is first released and many undiscovered bugs are encountered by users.
    *   As bugs are reported and fixed through patches and new versions, the failure rate tends to decrease over time.
    *   *Diagrammatic Description:* The curve starts high and gradually slopes downwards, ideally approaching zero but never quite reaching it.

2.  **Realistic Curve (Actual Curve):**
    *   The idealized curve is rarely observed in practice.
    *   When software is updated (e.g., new features added, existing code modified for maintenance), new bugs can be introduced. This causes the failure rate to spike upwards temporarily before it starts to decrease again as these new bugs are fixed.
    *   The curve often shows an initial decrease followed by spikes corresponding to major updates or changes.
    *   Software also suffers from "deterioration" due to changes in the operating environment (e.g., new OS versions, new hardware) if not properly maintained and adapted.
    *   *Diagrammatic Description:* The curve generally trends downwards but has upward spikes at points of significant change or updates. It does not have a wear-out phase like hardware.

**(A textual representation of the Software Failure Curve would show failure rate on the Y-axis and time on the X-axis. The idealized curve slopes downwards. The realistic curve also trends downwards but has intermittent spikes.)**

### b) Three Major Components of Software

Software is more than just code. The major components of software include:

1.  **Programs (Code):**
    *   This refers to the set of instructions, written in a programming language, that direct the computer's hardware to perform specific tasks.
    *   It includes source code, object code, executable files, and scripts.
    *   The quality of the code (e.g., correctness, efficiency, readability) is crucial for the software's functionality and maintainability.

2.  **Data Structures:**
    *   These are the ways data is organized, managed, and stored within the software.
    *   Effective data structures allow algorithms to operate efficiently on the data.
    *   Examples include arrays, linked lists, trees, databases, and configuration files that store data used by the programs.

3.  **Documentation:**
    *   This encompasses all written materials that explain how the software is constructed, how it operates, and how to use it.
    *   It includes:
        *   **User Documentation:** Manuals, tutorials, help files for end-users.
        *   **System Documentation:** Requirements specifications, design documents, API documentation, test plans, and comments within the code for developers and maintainers.
    *   Good documentation is essential for understanding, using, maintaining, and evolving the software.

### c) Four Major Factors Contributing to the Software Crisis

The "software crisis" refers to the difficulties experienced in developing and maintaining software, characterized by projects being over budget, delivered late, not meeting user requirements, or being unreliable and hard to maintain. Four major contributing factors include:

1.  **Increasing Complexity:**
    *   Software systems are becoming increasingly large and complex, dealing with more intricate problems, distributed environments, and vast amounts of data.
    *   Managing this complexity in terms of design, development, testing, and maintenance is a significant challenge.

2.  **Higher Expectations and Demands:**
    *   Users and businesses demand more sophisticated software with more features, higher performance, greater reliability, better user interfaces, and increased security.
    *   Meeting these ever-increasing expectations puts immense pressure on software developers and development processes.

3.  **Difficult and Costly Maintenance:**
    *   A large portion of software development effort (often over 60-70%) is spent on maintaining existing systems.
    *   Legacy systems, poor initial design, inadequate documentation, and constantly changing requirements make software maintenance difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. This is often termed "software entropy" where systems degrade over time if not actively maintained.

4.  **Shortage of Skilled Personnel and Immature Project Management:**
    *   There's often a gap between the demand for skilled software engineers and their availability.
    *   Coupled with this, immature or ineffective software project management practices (e.g., poor planning, unrealistic schedules, inadequate risk management, poor communication) lead to project failures or suboptimal outcomes.

## Question 2

**What is the need for a feasibility study in the Software Project Management Process? Explain any four types of feasibility study in Software Project Development.**

### a) Need for a Feasibility Study

A feasibility study is a critical preliminary investigation undertaken at the beginning of the Software Project Management Process. Its primary needs are:

1.  **To Determine Project Viability:** The foremost need is to assess whether the proposed software project is practical, achievable, and makes sense from technical, economic, and operational perspectives. It helps decide if the project is worth investing resources in.
2.  **To Identify Potential Risks and Problems:** It helps in proactively identifying potential challenges, risks, constraints, and roadblocks that might hinder the project's success. Early identification allows for mitigation strategies.
3.  **To Evaluate Alternatives:** A feasibility study often explores different approaches or solutions to the problem. It provides a basis for comparing these alternatives and selecting the most suitable one.
4.  **To Provide a Basis for Decision-Making:** The findings of the feasibility study provide crucial information to stakeholders (management, investors, users) to make an informed "go/no-go" decision about proceeding with the project.
5.  **To Refine Project Scope and Objectives:** The study helps in clarifying and refining the project's scope, objectives, and requirements, ensuring a better understanding of what needs to be delivered.
6.  **To Estimate Resources, Costs, and Timelines:** It provides initial estimates for the resources (human, financial, technological), costs, and time required for the project, which are essential for planning.
7.  **To Increase Probability of Success:** By addressing potential issues early and ensuring the project is sound, a feasibility study significantly increases the chances of project success.

### b) Four Types of Feasibility Study in Software Project Development

Several types of feasibility studies are conducted to assess a project from different angles. Four common types include:

1.  **Technical Feasibility:**
    *   **Focus:** Assesses whether the proposed system can be developed and implemented using existing technology, tools, and expertise.
    *   **Questions Addressed:**
        *   Is the required technology available and mature?
        *   Does the development team possess the necessary technical skills and experience?
        *   Can the system be integrated with existing systems?
        *   Are there significant technical risks (e.g., performance, security, scalability)?
    *   **Outcome:** Determines if the project is technically possible and if the organization has or can acquire the resources to build it.

2.  **Economic Feasibility (Cost-Benefit Analysis):**
    *   **Focus:** Evaluates the financial viability of the project by comparing the expected costs of development and operation against the anticipated benefits.
    *   **Questions Addressed:**
        *   What are the total costs involved (development, hardware, software, training, maintenance)?
        *   What are the tangible benefits (e.g., increased revenue, reduced operational costs) and intangible benefits (e.g., improved customer satisfaction, better decision-making)?
        *   Does the project offer a positive return on investment (ROI)?
        *   Are the benefits substantial enough to justify the costs?
    *   **Outcome:** Determines if the project is a worthwhile financial investment.

3.  **Operational Feasibility:**
    *   **Focus:** Assesses how well the proposed system will work within the organization's existing operational environment and whether it will be accepted and used by the end-users.
    *   **Questions Addressed:**
        *   Does the system align with the organization's strategic goals and business processes?
        *   Will the users be able to adapt to and effectively use the new system?
        *   Are there adequate support systems (e.g., training, helpdesk) in place?
        *   Will the system cause any disruption to current operations?
        *   Does it meet legal and ethical requirements?
    *   **Outcome:** Determines if the system will be effectively integrated and utilized within the organization.

4.  **Schedule Feasibility (Time Feasibility):**
    *   **Focus:** Determines whether the project can be completed within the specified or acceptable timeframe.
    *   **Questions Addressed:**
        *   Can the project be delivered by the required deadline?
        *   Are the time estimates realistic given the project scope and available resources?
        *   What are the implications of delays?
        *   Are there any critical dependencies that could impact the schedule?
    *   **Outcome:** Assesses the likelihood of meeting project deadlines and identifies potential scheduling risks.

## Question 3

**What do you understand by coupling and cohesion? What roles do they play in software design? Describe the properties of best coupling and cohesion giving examples of each.**

### a) Coupling and Cohesion

**Coupling:**
Coupling refers to the degree of interdependence or connection between different software modules (e.g., classes, functions, components). It measures how closely connected two modules are, or how much one module knows about or relies on another.
*   **Desirable Level:** Low coupling is desirable. This means modules are relatively independent, and changes in one module have minimal impact on others.

**Cohesion:**
Cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements within a single module belong together or are functionally related. It measures how focused a module is on performing a single, well-defined task or a set of closely related tasks.
*   **Desirable Level:** High cohesion is desirable. This means a module has a clear purpose and its internal elements work together to achieve that purpose.

### b) Roles of Coupling and Cohesion in Software Design

Coupling and cohesion are fundamental principles in software design, particularly in modular design. They play crucial roles in creating well-structured, maintainable, and robust software:

1.  **Guiding Modularization:** They help designers break down a complex system into smaller, manageable, and well-defined modules. The goal is to create modules that are highly cohesive internally and loosely coupled with other modules.
2.  **Improving Maintainability:**
    *   Low coupling makes it easier to modify or debug a module without unintentionally affecting other parts of the system.
    *   High cohesion makes a module easier to understand, as all its elements are related to a single purpose. This simplifies making changes within the module.
3.  **Enhancing Reusability:** Modules with high cohesion and low coupling are more likely to be reusable in different parts of the system or even in other projects because they are self-contained and have minimal external dependencies.
4.  **Increasing Understandability:** A system composed of highly cohesive, loosely coupled modules is easier to understand because each module can be comprehended in isolation.
5.  **Improving Testability:** Individual modules can be tested more easily if they are loosely coupled. High cohesion ensures that a module has a specific, testable function.
6.  **Promoting Robustness and Reducing Error Propagation:** Low coupling limits the "ripple effect" where a change or an error in one module propagates to other modules. This makes the system more resilient.

### c) Properties of Best Coupling and Cohesion with Examples

**Best Coupling (Lowest Level of Coupling): Data Coupling**

*   **Properties:**
    *   Modules interact by passing only necessary data as parameters.
    *   The data passed is simple (e.g., primitive types or simple data structures).
    *   Modules do not share global data or rely on the internal implementation details of other modules.
    *   Communication is explicit through parameter lists.
*   **Example:**
    Consider a function `calculateArea(length, width)` that calculates the area of a rectangle.
    ```java
    public class GeometryUtils {
        // Data coupling: length and width are passed as parameters
        public double calculateRectangleArea(double length, double width) {
            if (length <= 0 || width <= 0) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Length and width must be positive.");
            }
            return length * width;
        }
    }

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            GeometryUtils utils = new GeometryUtils();
            double area = utils.calculateRectangleArea(10.0, 5.0); // Calling module passes data
            System.out.println("Area: " + area);
        }
    }
    ```
    Here, `calculateRectangleArea` and `main` are data coupled. `main` passes `length` and `width` to `calculateRectangleArea`, and receives the `area` back. The modules don't know anything about each other's internal workings beyond the interface.

**Best Cohesion (Highest Level of Cohesion): Functional Cohesion**

*   **Properties:**
    *   All elements (e.g., lines of code, internal data) within the module contribute to the performance of a single, well-defined task or function.
    *   The module has a clear, specific purpose.
    *   It performs one and only one problem-related task.
*   **Example:**
    A module (e.g., a function or a class method) that calculates the square root of a number exhibits functional cohesion.
    ```java
    public class MathOperations {
        // Functional cohesion: This method performs a single, well-defined task.
        public double calculateSquareRoot(double number) {
            if (number < 0) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot calculate square root of a negative number.");
            }
            return Math.sqrt(number); // All operations contribute to calculating square root
        }
    }
    ```
    In this example, every part of the `calculateSquareRoot` method is essential for computing the square root of the input `number`. It doesn't perform any other unrelated operations.

## Question 5

**SRMAP has introduced a new software to calculate the grading scheme for Software Engineering Students. The grading scheme is as follows:**
*   **Marks >= 90 (O grade)**
*   **Marks >= 80 and <=89 ( A+ grade)**
*   **Marks >= 70 and <= 79 (A grade)**
*   **Marks >= 60 and <= 69 (B+ grade)**
*   **Marks >= 40 and <= 59 (P grade)**
*   **Marks < 40 (F grade)**

**Write a pseudocode to receive the Software Engineering marks of the student as input and calculate the grade based on the new grading scheme. Next, draw a Control Flow Graph (CFG) based on the pseudocode and compute the cyclometric complexity for the CFG. Finally, List all the independent paths that need to be tested.**

### a) Pseudocode

```pseudocode
PROCEDURE CalculateStudentGrade
  DECLARE marks AS INTEGER
  DECLARE grade AS STRING

  PRINT "Enter Software Engineering marks: "
  INPUT marks

  IF marks >= 90 AND marks <= 100 THEN  // Assuming max marks is 100
    grade = "O"
  ELSE IF marks >= 80 AND marks <= 89 THEN
    grade = "A+"
  ELSE IF marks >= 70 AND marks <= 79 THEN
    grade = "A"
  ELSE IF marks >= 60 AND marks <= 69 THEN
    grade = "B+"
  ELSE IF marks >= 40 AND marks <= 59 THEN
    grade = "P"
  ELSE IF marks >= 0 AND marks < 40 THEN // Assuming min marks is 0
    grade = "F"
  ELSE
    grade = "Invalid Marks" // Handle out-of-range marks
  END IF

  PRINT "The grade is: " + grade
END PROCEDURE
```
*(Note: Added boundary checks for marks 0-100 for robustness, which slightly modifies the CFG complexity if each part of `AND` is a separate predicate or if the `ELSE "Invalid Marks"` path is considered.)*

For simplicity, let's stick to the direct interpretation of the problem's conditions for the CFG and complexity calculation, assuming marks are within a valid range for the grading logic itself. The original problem implies a cascading if-else structure.

Revised Pseudocode (closer to direct interpretation for CFG):
```pseudocode
PROCEDURE CalculateGrade(marks)
  DECLARE grade AS STRING

  IF marks >= 90 THEN
    grade = "O"
  ELSE IF marks >= 80 THEN // No need for AND marks <= 89 due to if-else structure
    grade = "A+"
  ELSE IF marks >= 70 THEN
    grade = "A"
  ELSE IF marks >= 60 THEN
    grade = "B+"
  ELSE IF marks >= 40 THEN
    grade = "P"
  ELSE // marks < 40
    grade = "F"
  END IF

  PRINT "Calculated grade: " + grade
END PROCEDURE

// Main part to call the procedure
BEGIN
  DECLARE studentMarks AS INTEGER
  PRINT "Enter Software Engineering marks: "
  INPUT studentMarks
  CALL CalculateGrade(studentMarks)
END
```

### b) Control Flow Graph (CFG)

Let's base the CFG on the revised pseudocode for `CalculateGrade(marks)`:

**Nodes:**
1.  Start (Begin `CalculateGrade`)
2.  `marks >= 90`? (Predicate Node P1)
3.  `grade = "O"`
4.  `marks >= 80`? (Predicate Node P2)
5.  `grade = "A+"`
6.  `marks >= 70`? (Predicate Node P3)
7.  `grade = "A"`
8.  `marks >= 60`? (Predicate Node P4)
9.  `grade = "B+"`
10. `marks >= 40`? (Predicate Node P5)
11. `grade = "P"`
12. `grade = "F"` (Else block)
13. `PRINT "Calculated grade: " + grade` (Converging node)
14. End (End `CalculateGrade`)

**Edges:**
*   1 -> 2
*   2 -> 3 (True branch for P1)
*   2 -> 4 (False branch for P1)
*   3 -> 13
*   4 -> 5 (True branch for P2)
*   4 -> 6 (False branch for P2)
*   5 -> 13
*   6 -> 7 (True branch for P3)
*   6 -> 8 (False branch for P3)
*   7 -> 13
*   8 -> 9 (True branch for P4)
*   8 -> 10 (False branch for P4)
*   9 -> 13
*   10 -> 11 (True branch for P5)
*   10 -> 12 (False branch for P5)
*   11 -> 13
*   12 -> 13
*   13 -> 14

### c) Cyclomatic Complexity (V(G))

Cyclomatic Complexity can be calculated using three methods:
1.  `V(G) = E - N + 2P`
    *   N (Number of nodes) = 14
    *   E (Number of edges) = 1 (1->2) + 2 (from 2) + 1 (3->13) + 2 (from 4) + 1 (5->13) + 2 (from 6) + 1 (7->13) + 2 (from 8) + 1 (9->13) + 2 (from 10) + 1 (11->13) + 1 (12->13) + 1 (13->14) = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18 edges.
    *   P (Number of connected components) = 1 (for a single procedure)
    *   V(G) = 18 - 14 + 2 * 1 = 4 + 2 = 6

2.  `V(G) = P + 1`
    *   P (Number of predicate nodes/decision points) = 5 (Nodes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
    *   V(G) = 5 + 1 = 6

3.  `V(G) = Number of regions` in the planar graph. If drawn, this would also yield 6.

**So, the Cyclomatic Complexity V(G) = 6.**

### d) Independent Paths

There should be V(G) = 6 independent paths:
1.  **Path 1 (O Grade):** 1 -> 2(T) -> 3 -> 13 -> 14 (e.g., marks = 95)
2.  **Path 2 (A+ Grade):** 1 -> 2(F) -> 4(T) -> 5 -> 13 -> 14 (e.g., marks = 85)
3.  **Path 3 (A Grade):** 1 -> 2(F) -> 4(F) -> 6(T) -> 7 -> 13 -> 14 (e.g., marks = 75)
4.  **Path 4 (B+ Grade):** 1 -> 2(F) -> 4(F) -> 6(F) -> 8(T) -> 9 -> 13 -> 14 (e.g., marks = 65)
5.  **Path 5 (P Grade):** 1 -> 2(F) -> 4(F) -> 6(F) -> 8(F) -> 10(T) -> 11 -> 13 -> 14 (e.g., marks = 45)
6.  **Path 6 (F Grade):** 1 -> 2(F) -> 4(F) -> 6(F) -> 8(F) -> 10(F) -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 (e.g., marks = 35)

## Question 6

**Number of external inputs (Els) = 25**
**Number of external output (EOs) = 31**
**Number of external inquiries (EQs) = 20**
**Number of files (ILF) = 07**
**Number of external interfaces (EIF) = 05**

**The complexity weighting factors for Els, EOs, EQs, ILFs, and EIFs are 3, 5, 6, 10, and 5, respectively. The responses for the fourteen value adjustment factors (VAF) that influence the development effort are as follows:**
*   **Four factors have received “Not Influential/Important ” as a response.**
*   **Another four factors have received “Essential” as a response.**
*   **The remaining factors have received “Moderate” as a response.**

**You need to Calculate the following for the software project:**
1.  **Total Unadjusted Function points (UFP)/ count total;**
2.  **Cumulative Adjustment Factor (CAF)**
3.  **Total Adjusted Function Points (AFP)**

**Suppose we are estimating the effort required to develop a software product with an estimated size of 128 KLOC (thousands of lines of code). We will use the Intermediate COCOMO model and consider the following cost drivers:**
*   **Required software reliability: Low**
*   **Size of the application database: Nominal**
*   **Complexity of the product: Very High**
*   **Run-time performance constraints: Extra High**
*   **Memory constraints: Very High**
*   **Volatility of the virtual machine environment: Nominal**
*   **Analyst capability: Very high**
*   **Virtual machine experience: Nominal**
*   **Language experience: Nominal**
*   **Use of software tools: Very Low**
*   **Required development schedule: Low**

**Calculate the Effort and Duration using the Intermediate COCOMO model.**

### Part A: Function Point Calculation

**1. Total Unadjusted Function Points (UFP)**

UFP is calculated by summing the weighted values of each function type:
*   External Inputs (EI): 25 * 3 = 75
*   External Outputs (EO): 31 * 5 = 155
*   External Inquiries (EQ): 20 * 6 = 120
*   Internal Logical Files (ILF): 7 * 10 = 70
*   External Interface Files (EIF): 5 * 5 = 25

**UFP = 75 + 155 + 120 + 70 + 25 = 445**

**2. Cumulative Adjustment Factor (CAF) / Value Adjustment Factor (VAF)**

There are 14 Value Adjustment Factors (General System Characteristics). Each is rated on a scale of 0 to 5 (Not Present/Influential to Essential).
*   4 factors are "Not Influential/Important" (rating = 0): 4 * 0 = 0
*   4 factors are "Essential" (rating = 5): 4 * 5 = 20
*   Remaining factors = 14 - 4 - 4 = 6 factors.
    These are "Moderate". Assuming "Moderate" corresponds to a rating of 3 on the 0-5 scale.
    6 factors are "Moderate" (rating = 3): 6 * 3 = 18

Total Degree of Influence (DI) = Sum of ratings for all 14 factors
DI = 0 + 20 + 18 = 38

The formula for CAF is:
CAF = 0.65 + (0.01 * DI)
CAF = 0.65 + (0.01 * 38)
CAF = 0.65 + 0.38
**CAF = 1.03**

**3. Total Adjusted Function Points (AFP)**

AFP is calculated by multiplying UFP by CAF:
AFP = UFP * CAF
AFP = 445 * 1.03
**AFP = 458.35**

### Part B: Intermediate COCOMO Model Calculation

Given:
*   Size (KLOC) = 128
*   Since 50 < KLOC <= 300, this is a **Semi-Detached** project.
    *   For Effort: a = 3.0, b = 1.12
    *   For Duration: c = 2.5, d = 0.35

**Cost Driver Multipliers (from the provided table):**
*   Required software reliability (RELY): Low = 0.88
*   Size of the application database (DATA): Nominal = 1.00
*   Complexity of the product (CPLX): Very High = 1.30
*   Run-time performance constraints (TIME): Extra High = 1.66
*   Memory constraints (STOR): Very High = 1.56
*   Volatility of the virtual machine environment (VIRT): Nominal = 1.00
*   Analyst capability (ACAP): Very High = 0.71
*   Virtual machine experience (VEXP): Nominal = 1.00
*   Language experience (LEXP): Nominal = 1.00 (Programming language experience)
*   Use of software tools (TOOL): Very Low = 1.24
*   Required development schedule (SCED): Low = 1.08

**Effort Adjustment Factor (EAF):**
EAF is the product of all applicable cost driver multipliers.
EAF = RELY * DATA * CPLX * TIME * STOR * VIRT * ACAP * VEXP * LEXP * TOOL * SCED
EAF = 0.88 * 1.00 * 1.30 * 1.66 * 1.56 * 1.00 * 0.71 * 1.00 * 1.00 * 1.24 * 1.08
EAF = 0.88 * 1.30 * 1.66 * 1.56 * 0.71 * 1.24 * 1.08
EAF = 1.144 * 1.66 * 1.56 * 0.71 * 1.24 * 1.08
EAF = 1.89904 * 1.56 * 0.71 * 1.24 * 1.08
EAF = 2.9625024 * 0.71 * 1.24 * 1.08
EAF = 2.103376704 * 1.24 * 1.08
EAF = 2.60818711296 * 1.08
**EAF ≈ 2.8168** (Using more precision: 2.816842082)

**Calculate Effort (E):**
Effort (E) = a * (KLOC)^b * EAF
E = 3.0 * (128)^1.12 * 2.8168
First, calculate (128)^1.12:
log10(128^1.12) = 1.12 * log10(128) = 1.12 * 2.107209969 = 2.359075165
128^1.12 = 10^2.359075165 ≈ 228.631
E = 3.0 * 228.631 * 2.8168
E = 685.893 * 2.8168
**E ≈ 1932.24 Person-Months**

**Calculate Duration (D):**
Duration (D) = c * (Effort)^d
D = 2.5 * (1932.24)^0.35
First, calculate (1932.24)^0.35:
log10(1932.24^0.35) = 0.35 * log10(1932.24) = 0.35 * 3.286059 = 1.15012065
1932.24^0.35 = 10^1.15012065 ≈ 14.129
D = 2.5 * 14.129
**D ≈ 35.32 Months**

**Summary of COCOMO Results:**
*   **Effort (E) ≈ 1932.24 Person-Months**
*   **Development Time (D) ≈ 35.32 Months**
